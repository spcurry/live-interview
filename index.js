/**
 * This will be a Node.js server-side application. 
 * 
 * Express.js is already installed, but you can use whatever frameworks you like to create this application.
 * 
 * This application will have 2 objectives.
 * 
 *   1.) Create an API endpoint at "/customers" that is a reverse proxy for the following API. You can use Postman to test this API first if you would like.
 *      - {
 *            url: https://interview.form.io/customers/submission,
 *            method: 'GET',
 *            headers: {
 *                'x-token': [VALUE PROVIDED BY INTERVIEWER]
 *            }
 *        }
 *           
 *   2.) Statically host the "public" folder at the root level of the node server. For example, if I navigate to https://localhost:3000 it will show me the website (index.html) within the public folder.
