## Application Bundle
This code is auto generated by the ```webpack``` command. In order to make changes to this bundle, you will need to modify the code within the "src" folder.

Once your changes have been made you can create a new bundle by typing the following command.

```
npm run build
```

Once you have a new bundle, you will then need to 'mount' this folder as accessible by the Node.js server within the root "index.js" file. Mount it so that the root of the node server will show the application. For example, if you navigate to https://localhost:3000 you will see the application.
